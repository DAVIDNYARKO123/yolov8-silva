# YoloV8-Silva

The most recent and cutting-edge `YOLO` model, `YoloV8`, can be utilized for applications including object identification, image categorization, and instance segmentation. `Ultralytics`, who also produced the influentialÂ `YOLOv5` model that defined the industry, developed `YOLOv8`. Compared to `YOLOv5`, `YOLOv8` has a number of architectural updates and enhancements.

## Silva-Flow

We are simply using `YOLO` models in a python environment with opencv on `Windows`, `Mac` or `Linux` system. It can be imported from the ultralytics module

Two example codes were defined for the module
`yolov8_basics.py` and `yolov8_n_opencv.py`

## Using `yolov8_n_opencv.py`

`Use YoloV8 is an OpenCV way`. Have control over detection on each frame and choose what happens per detection.

```python
python yolov8_n_opencv.py
```
